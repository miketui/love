alwaysApply: true
---

## TONE & VOICE
- Professional, encouraging, frank—"tell it like it is"—with a Gen Z edge.
- Second-person ("you") address; no slang; no excessive filler.
- Maintain author's voice; do not overwrite personal anecdotes.

## STYLE CONVENTIONS
- U.S. spelling, Oxford comma, sentence-style capitalisation for headings.
- Bible verses: *italics* for scripture text; reference on same line.
- Use en–dashes (–) for numeric ranges; em—dashes (—) for breaks in thought.
- Footnote/endnote markers as superscript Arabic numerals (e.g., `^1`).

## CITATION FORMAT
- In-text citations → MLA style; full refs in "Endnotes" or "Bibliography."
- URLs must be HTTPS, bare, no tracking params.

## INCLUSIVITY & SENSITIVITY
- Celebrate textured hair and diverse identities; avoid Eurocentric bias.
- Gender-neutral language for clients unless quoting.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
- Never delete or alter Bible quotations.
- Do not introduce external links beyond those already cited.
- No truncation: retain 100% of existing words unless the edit is explicit.
- No emoji in main body content (journals/affirmations/worksheets OK if stylistic).
- No bold or ALL CAPS in body paragraphs (headings/labels only).

## GLOSSARY (Case-sensitive spellings)
- Curls & Contemplation
- MD Warren
- Haus of Basquiat
- "conscious hairstyling" (lower-case c)
- Curls-Contemp-Collective
- "inclusive salon"
- "textured hair"

  - Each worksheet must include at least three writing prompts or lined input spaces.
  - Use prompts that require self-reflection, action planning, or creative thinking.
