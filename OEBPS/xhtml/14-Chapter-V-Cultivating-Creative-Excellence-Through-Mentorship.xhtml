<h2 id="section5-1">The Alchemical Influence of Iconic Mentors</h2>

<p>Mentorship in hairstyling is a rich tradition shaped by visionary leaders who have expanded the boundaries of creativity and technique, inspiring countless stylists to redefine the limits of their own potential. The following profiles showcase the impact of three renowned mentors whose influence has transformed the industry and the lives of those they mentor.<sup>3</sup></p>

<h3 id="section5-1-1">Yusef Williams: Unleashing Improvisational Brilliance</h3>

<p>Standing beside Yusef Williams is like watching creativity in real time. Known for his work with iconic figures like Rihanna and Iman, Williams exemplifies the transformative power of mentorship rooted in improvisational creativity and fearless experimentation. His approach with mentees is akin to that of an artist unveiling a new medium, urging stylists to push beyond traditional boundaries and explore uncharted territory in their work.</p>

<p>Williams' philosophy centers on spontaneity, encouraging his mentees to approach every styling opportunity as a blank canvas. His guidance often includes an invitation to embrace unexpected outcomes, recognizing that true creative breakthroughs often arise from embracing the unplanned. "In this industry, playing it safe is the riskiest thing you can do," he tells his protégés. His words resonate deeply with those he mentors, pushing them to abandon fear of failure and take risks that lead to their most innovative work.</p>

<p><strong>Key Elements of Williams' Mentorship Style:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embracing Imperfection:</strong> Williams views "mistakes" as opportunities for innovation. He encourages mentees to work with unexpected outcomes rather than trying to correct them, turning accidental asymmetry, for example, into a deliberate design feature.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Pollination of Ideas:</strong> He introduces mentees to inspiration beyond the salon, drawing from fashion, architecture, and nature. This could mean developing a color palette inspired by a sunset or experimenting with a technique that reflects the bold geometry of urban design.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Flexibility:</strong> Williams teaches stylists to adapt techniques to suit each client's unique hair texture and style preferences. Rather than adhering rigidly to a single method, he encourages fluidity, which allows for a truly customized client experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Williams' mentorship does not just elevate technical skills; it cultivates resilience and adaptability. His protégés are taught to navigate the unpredictable landscape of fashion and beauty with confidence, transforming them into versatile and forward-thinking stylists capable of shaping the industry.</p>

<h3 id="section5-1-2">Naeemah Lafond: Mastering Precision and Patience</h3>

<p>In contrast to Williams' improvisational style, Naeemah Lafond, the global artistic director for Amika, embodies a mentorship style rooted in precision, patience, and deliberate artistry. Known for her intricate, sculptural styles and meticulous attention to detail, Lafond teaches her mentees that mastery is achieved through dedication, discipline, and a deep appreciation for the fine details that elevate a hairstyle from good to extraordinary.</p>

<p>Imagine Lafond in her studio, guiding a mentee through the creation of a precise, structured bob. Her movements are deliberate, each snip and stroke a demonstration of patience honed over years. "Greatness lies in the details," she often reminds her students. Lafond's teaching goes beyond technique, instilling a respect for the craft that encourages mentees to view hairstyling as an art that deserves reverence and meticulous care.</p>

<p><strong>Key Elements of Lafond's Mentorship Style:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundational Excellence:</strong> Lafond insists that her mentees perfect the basics before advancing to complex styles, understanding that mastery of foundational techniques is crucial for innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Mindful Practice:</strong> Her mentorship includes mindfulness exercises, guiding mentees to remain present and focused on the task at hand. This approach fosters a calm, intentional environment that allows for refined artistry.</li>
<li><strong>Client-Centric Creativity:</strong> Lafond balances creative vision with client needs, teaching her mentees to create styles that are both aesthetically pleasing and suited to the client's lifestyle and personality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through her mentorship, Lafond instills not only technical expertise but also a sense of responsibility to honor each client's individuality. Her mentees leave with a deep understanding of hairstyling as a craft that marries precision with personalized beauty.</p>

<h3 id="section5-1-3">Vernon François: Celebrating Textured Hair's Organic Glory</h3>

<p>Vernon François approaches mentorship with a profound respect for the natural beauty of textured hair, empowering his mentees to celebrate curls, coils, and kinks with authenticity and confidence. François has gained global recognition for his innovative work with textured hair, from celebrities like Lupita Nyong'o to advocacy for natural hair acceptance worldwide.</p>

<p>Imagine a workshop with François, where stylists are invited to explore textured hair's unique patterns and possibilities. His workshops are both technical and cultural, focusing not only on styling techniques but also on the historical and emotional significance of natural hair for many clients. "To work with textured hair is to honor its story and its strength," he tells his mentees, emphasizing the importance of understanding and respecting each client's cultural identity.</p>

<p><strong>Key Elements of François' Mentorship Style:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Texture Education:</strong> François offers in-depth instruction on curl patterns, porosity, and texture-specific care, helping mentees become knowledgeable advocates for textured hair.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative Styling Techniques:</strong> He teaches stylists to enhance natural textures rather than manipulate or alter them, fostering creativity that celebrates each client's individuality.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> François integrates discussions on the cultural significance of natural hair, equipping his mentees to serve clients with empathy and respect.</li>
</ul>

<p>By cultivating respect for textured hair and promoting inclusivity in beauty, François' mentorship has a transformative impact not only on individual careers but on the industry as a whole. His mentees learn to create styles that are not only visually stunning but also empowering for clients, embracing a philosophy that beauty exists in every natural form.</p>

<p>Each of these mentors—Williams, Lafond, and François—demonstrates a unique approach to hairstyling that transcends technique and inspires a deeper understanding of the craft. Their influence extends far beyond individual clients, shaping a new generation of stylists who carry forward a legacy of creativity, professionalism, and inclusivity. Their mentorship styles reflect the diversity and richness of the hairstyling industry, offering valuable lessons for stylists at every stage of their careers.</p>

<h2 id="section5-2">Finding Your Perfect Mentorship Match</h2>

<p>Finding a mentor whose style, values, and expertise resonate with your own vision can be a pivotal step in your career. This journey starts with self-reflection and intentional research. Defining your creative identity, values, and goals is the foundation of finding a mentor who can guide and inspire you on a path aligned with your aspirations.<sup>4</sup></p>

<h3 id="section5-2-1">Defining Your Creative Identity and Values</h3>

<p>To begin this process, it is crucial to gain clarity on what you want to achieve and how you view your own role in the hairstyling world. Imagine sitting with a journal, answering questions designed to bring your creative identity to the forefront. Ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are my strengths and areas for growth as a hairstylist?</li>
<li>What values guide my approach to hairstyling?</li>
<li>How do I want my work to impact clients and the industry?</li>
<li>What does success look like to me, both personally and professionally?</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if you value inclusivity, you might seek a mentor who champions diverse beauty standards and has experience working with a broad range of hair textures. This self-awareness is essential in helping you identify mentors whose values and methods align with your own. A clear sense of your identity and aspirations also strengthens your ability to communicate your needs and goals effectively to potential mentors, fostering a relationship built on mutual understanding and respect.</p>

<h3 id="section5-2-2">Researching Potential Mentors Aligned with Your Vision</h3>

<p>Once you have clarity on your creative identity, the next step is to actively seek mentors who resonate with your vision. This involves thorough research and observation. Here are some strategies for finding the right mentor:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze Their Body of Work:</strong> Review the portfolios of potential mentors, looking for recurring themes or techniques that resonate with your own aesthetic preferences. Notice how they interact with diverse clientele and how they push the boundaries of traditional styling.</li>
<li><strong>Seek Out Interviews and Articles:</strong> Many seasoned stylists share insights into their creative processes and philosophies through interviews or written pieces. This can provide a deeper understanding of their values, approach, and attitude toward mentorship.</li>
<li><strong>Observe Their Social Media Presence:</strong> Social media provides a glimpse into a mentor's day-to-day work and their level of engagement with their audience. Some stylists use platforms like Instagram or YouTube to share tutorials, advice, or behind-the-scenes insights, allowing you to gauge their teaching style.</li>
<li><strong>Attend Industry Events:</strong> Whenever possible, attend workshops, shows, or seminars led by stylists you admire. Watching them work and interact with other stylists offers valuable insights into their mentorship style and professional ethos.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Recommendations:</strong> Reach out to other stylists or professionals in the industry for mentor recommendations. A personal referral can provide assurance about a mentor's approachability, integrity, and teaching effectiveness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, the goal is to find someone who aligns with your aspirations and whose influence can help you refine your own style and approach to hairstyling. Keep a list of potential mentors, noting their unique strengths and what you hope to learn from each. This preparation will be invaluable when you are ready to approach them for mentorship.</p>

<h2 id="section5-3">From Mentee to Mentor: Embarking on the Journey</h2>

<p>As you advance in your career, you may find yourself drawn to the role of mentor, ready to guide others as you were once guided. Stepping into this role requires confidence, empathy, and a commitment to fostering growth. The transition from mentee to mentor is a transformative process that allows you to create a lasting impact by sharing your expertise, experiences, and values.<sup>5</sup></p>

<h3 id="section5-3-1">Building Confidence as a Mentor</h3>

<p>Becoming a mentor often brings with it a sense of responsibility. You may wonder if you are "experienced enough" or if you have enough knowledge to guide others. The truth is, mentorship is not about having all the answers; it is about sharing your journey, including both triumphs and challenges, in an honest and supportive way. Here are some ways to build your confidence as a mentor:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reflect on Your Journey:</strong> Take time to think about the moments that have defined your career. Consider how you navigated obstacles and achieved milestones, and how these experiences can offer valuable lessons to a mentee.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace Imperfections:</strong> Mentorship is not about perfection; it is about authenticity. Share not only your successes but also your mistakes, and encourage mentees to view setbacks as learning opportunities. This makes you relatable and helps mentees feel comfortable taking risks.</li>
<li><strong>Start Small:</strong> You do not need to formally "announce" yourself as a mentor. Begin by offering guidance to junior stylists on a casual basis. This could be as simple as offering constructive feedback during a styling session or sharing tips in a friendly conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Building confidence as a mentor comes with practice, reflection, and a genuine desire to help others succeed. As you grow into this role, remember that mentorship is as much about learning as it is about teaching, and you will continue to evolve through the experiences you share with your mentees.</p>

<h3 id="section5-3-2">Creating an Inclusive Mentorship Environment</h3>

<p>Mentorship has the potential to build a more inclusive and welcoming hairstyling community. As a mentor, creating a supportive environment means honoring each mentee's unique background, identity, and experiences. This inclusive approach fosters trust, encourages open communication, and empowers mentees to embrace their individuality. Here is how to create an inclusive mentorship environment:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Respect Differences:</strong> Each mentee brings a unique perspective shaped by their cultural background, gender, and personal experiences. Take the time to understand these differences and incorporate them into your guidance, showing that diversity enriches creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Open Dialogue:</strong> Let mentees know that their thoughts, questions, and concerns are valued. Create a safe space where they feel comfortable expressing themselves and asking questions, fostering mutual understanding and learning.</li>
<li><strong>Adapt Your Mentorship Style:</strong> Each mentee learns differently. Some may thrive with structured guidance, while others might benefit from a more exploratory approach. Adapt your mentorship style to meet the needs of each individual, ensuring that they feel supported in a way that best suits their growth.</li>
<li><strong>Model Inclusivity:</strong> Demonstrate inclusive practices in the workplace by using language and imagery that honors diversity. Promote a culture of acceptance, whether through salon decor that features a range of hair textures or by fostering respectful discussions around hair identity and self-expression.</li>
</ul>

<p>By creating an inclusive mentorship environment, you build a community where every mentee feels respected, valued, and empowered to pursue their unique vision in hairstyling. This approach not only benefits the individuals you mentor but also contributes to a more open and progressive industry.</p>

<h2 id="section5-4">Developing a Mentorship Philosophy</h2>

<p>A mentorship philosophy serves as a guiding framework that shapes how you approach and sustain your mentorship relationships. Crafting a clear and authentic mentorship philosophy can help you align your actions with your values, creating a consistent and impactful experience for your mentees.<sup>6</sup></p>

<h3 id="section5-4-1">Steps to Develop Your Mentorship Philosophy</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Define Your Core Values:</strong> Reflect on the principles that guide your work as a stylist and a mentor. These might include creativity, integrity, inclusivity, or lifelong learning. Think about how these values influence the way you interact with clients and mentees alike.</li>
<li><strong>Clarify Your Purpose as a Mentor:</strong> Consider what drives you to share your knowledge with others. Are you passionate about fostering creativity in new stylists? Do you want to ensure that emerging talent receives the support you once valued? Articulating your purpose will give direction to your mentorship efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Outline Your Teaching Style:</strong> Think about how you prefer to teach and guide others. Do you favor hands-on demonstrations, structured workshops, or informal conversations? Define the key elements of your teaching style that you believe are most effective in promoting growth and confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Set Mentorship Goals:</strong> Establish specific goals that you aim to achieve through mentorship. These could include helping mentees master foundational techniques, supporting them in career development, or inspiring them to find their unique creative voice. Clear goals provide focus and help ensure that your mentorship is impactful.</li>
<li><strong>Document Your Philosophy:</strong> Once you have considered these elements, write down your mentorship philosophy. This statement should be a concise summary of your approach, values, and goals as a mentor. It serves as a powerful reminder of your commitment to nurturing talent and creating a positive influence in the industry.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example of a Mentorship Philosophy:</strong></p>

<p>"As a mentor, I am dedicated to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment where creativity, integrity, and empathy guide every interaction. I believe in the power of individualized mentorship, adapting my guidance to each mentee's unique strengths and aspirations. My goal is to help stylists not only master their technical skills but also develop a deep appreciation for the transformative power of hairstyling. Through authenticity, open communication, and a commitment to continuous learning, I strive to empower the next generation to shape the beauty industry with integrity and innovation."</p>

<p>By developing a mentorship philosophy, you lay a foundation that ensures your guidance is consistent, meaningful, and aligned with your values. This philosophy serves as both a personal compass and a source of clarity for your mentees, helping them understand what they can expect from your mentorship.</p>

<h2 id="section5-5">Case Study: From Mentee to Mentor - The Journey of Marco Reyes</h2>

<p>In the hairstyling industry, the journey from mentee to mentor exemplifies the cyclical nature of learning and growth. One compelling example is the story of Marco Reyes, a freelance editorial stylist who successfully transitioned from an eager mentee to a dedicated mentor, leaving an enduring mark on his field.<sup>7</sup></p>

<h3 id="section5-5-1">Marco's Early Career and Mentorship Experience</h3>

<p>Marco Reyes began his career with limited resources but boundless ambition. After attending beauty school in his native Mexico City, he moved to New York with dreams of working in high-fashion editorial styling. His breakthrough came when he secured an apprenticeship under renowned stylist James Pecis, known for innovative avant-garde work and technical precision.</p>

<p>The mentorship was transformative for Marco. Pecis emphasized not only technical excellence but also artistic vision, teaching Marco to see hairstyling as a form of personal expression. "James showed me that creating a hairstyle is like telling a story—each element should have purpose and meaning," Marco recalls. Through rigorous training sessions, Pecis instilled in Marco the importance of preparation, attention to detail, and creative problem-solving.</p>

<p>This relationship was defined by high standards and honest feedback. Pecis would challenge Marco to justify his creative choices, pushing him to develop both technical skill and artistic confidence. "He never let me settle for 'good enough,'" Marco shares. "He taught me that excellence comes from constant questioning and refinement."</p>

<h3 id="section5-5-2">Building a Reputation and Finding His Voice</h3>

<p>Marco's dedication to his craft and the guidance of his mentor quickly led to opportunities with fashion magazines and designers. He became known for architectural, sculptural styles that married technical precision with cultural influences from his Latin American heritage. As his reputation grew, so did his desire to give back to the community that had supported him.</p>

<p>Marco began to notice young stylists, particularly those from immigrant backgrounds, who faced the same challenges he had encountered. Recognizing their potential and recalling his own journey, he decided to transition into a mentorship role. His motivation stemmed from a desire to create pathways for talented newcomers who might otherwise struggle to break into the industry.</p>

<p>His journey into mentorship began informally, with Marco offering guidance to junior stylists on photoshoots and sharing his insights with junior stylists in his network. However, as he became more intentional about guiding others, he established a structured mentorship program that combined technical training with professional development guidance, focusing particularly on helping underrepresented stylists navigate the industry.</p>

<h3 id="section5-5-3">Establishing a Mentorship Philosophy</h3>

<p>Marco's mentorship philosophy centers on three core principles: technical excellence, cultural authenticity, and community responsibility. He believes in equipping mentees with impeccable technical skills while encouraging them to draw inspiration from their unique cultural backgrounds. Moreover, he emphasizes the importance of using success to create opportunities for others.</p>

<p>One of Marco's mentees, Elena, struggled with confidence despite her natural talent. Through his guidance, Marco helped her recognize how her Mexican-American heritage could inform her creative vision, encouraging her to incorporate traditional techniques into modern styles. Under his mentorship, Elena developed both skill and confidence, eventually securing editorial work with major publications and launching her own mentorship initiative for Latina stylists.</p>

<h3 id="section5-5-4">Impact and Legacy</h3>

<p>Marco's journey from mentee to mentor demonstrates how mentorship creates a powerful ripple effect throughout the industry. His editorial work has been featured in publications like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, but he considers his greatest achievement to be the success of his mentees. Through workshops, one-on-one guidance, and his "Next Wave" initiative spotlighting emerging talent, Marco has helped dozens of stylists—particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds—build successful careers.</p>

<p>By fostering technical excellence, cultural authenticity, and community responsibility, Marco exemplifies how mentorship shapes not only individual careers but also elevates the standards and values within hairstyling as a whole. His story illustrates that mentorship, at its core, is about creating a legacy that goes beyond one's career to uplift the industry and inspire future generations.</p>

<h2 id="section5-6">The Impact of Mentorship on the Hairstyling Industry</h2>

<p>Mentorship extends its influence far beyond the individual mentee. As stylists pass down their knowledge, values, and skills, they create a ripple effect that enhances industry standards, fosters innovation, and cultivates a more supportive and inclusive community. This section explores how mentorship strengthens the hairstyling industry and why it is vital for the profession's growth and sustainability.<sup>8</sup></p>

<h3 id="section5-6-1">Elevating Standards and Driving Innovation</h3>

<p>Experienced mentors set high standards for technical skills, professionalism, and creativity, which mentees then carry forward into their own practices. By teaching best practices and emphasizing ethical guidelines, mentors help ensure that a high level of quality becomes the norm across the industry. This commitment to excellence helps elevate the profession as a whole, encouraging a culture of respect and integrity among stylists.</p>

<p>Additionally, mentorship fosters an environment where innovation thrives. As mentors guide their mentees to experiment, adapt, and question conventional approaches, they promote a mindset of creativity and exploration. This culture of innovation drives the development of new trends, techniques, and tools that keep the industry dynamic and exciting. By challenging mentees to think beyond traditional styles, mentors encourage a new generation of hairstylists to contribute fresh ideas, leading to a more diverse and vibrant industry.</p>

<p><strong>Real-World Example: Vidal Sassoon's Lasting Influence</strong></p>

<p>Vidal Sassoon is a prime example of a mentor whose impact transformed the hairstyling world. Known for his innovative geometric cuts and "wash-and-wear" philosophy, Sassoon mentored stylists who have since passed down his revolutionary techniques. This legacy of innovation and skill not only raised the standards of hairstyling but also reshaped global beauty culture. Today, his influence is evident in salons worldwide, where stylists continue to use his techniques and ethos, proving that mentorship has the power to create lasting, industry-wide change.</p>

<h3 id="section5-6-2">Cultivating a Supportive Community</h3>

<p>The hairstyling industry, though competitive, is also a deeply collaborative field. Mentorship cultivates a sense of community by building strong networks of professionals who support one another. These networks, fostered through mentor-mentee relationships, extend beyond the salon, providing emotional support, career guidance, and opportunities for collaboration.</p>

<p>For stylists who may feel isolated, especially in freelancing or independent roles, mentorship offers a vital sense of belonging. The guidance and encouragement provided by mentors contribute significantly to a stylist's confidence, mental well-being, and career satisfaction. This sense of community ultimately benefits the industry as a whole, as stylists who feel supported are more likely to give back, mentor others, and foster an environment where everyone can succeed.</p>

<p><strong>Real-World Example: The Hair Has No Gender Project</strong></p>

<p>The Hair Has No Gender project, launched by hair professionals in Europe, is an example of how mentorship and a shared sense of community can drive positive change. This initiative provides training and mentorship to stylists on gender-neutral haircare, creating an inclusive environment for clients across gender identities. By supporting stylists in developing skills and understanding in this area, the project fosters a more inclusive, respectful, and progressive hairstyling community.<sup>9</sup></p>

<h3 id="section5-6-3">Creating a Culture of Lifelong Learning</h3>

<p>Mentorship instills a culture of continuous learning within the hairstyling industry. Stylists who experience mentorship are often inspired to keep honing their skills, staying up-to-date with trends, and expanding their knowledge. This commitment to lifelong learning creates a more skilled and adaptable workforce, ensuring that the industry remains relevant and capable of meeting evolving client needs.</p>

<p>Moreover, stylists who have been mentored are more likely to continue the tradition, becoming mentors themselves and perpetuating a cycle of growth and learning. This ongoing exchange of knowledge strengthens the hairstyling community, bridging the gap between generations and ensuring that valuable skills, traditions, and innovations are preserved and passed down.</p>

<h2 id="section5-7">Key Takeaways on the Power of Mentorship</h2>

<p>Mentorship in hairstyling serves as a transformative experience, benefiting both mentors and mentees while contributing to a more vibrant, inclusive, and innovative industry. Here are the essential takeaways on mentorship's influence, its reciprocal nature, and its broader impact:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mentorship Fosters Reciprocal Growth:</strong> The process of mentorship benefits both mentor and mentee, creating opportunities for mutual learning. Mentors share valuable expertise and gain fresh perspectives, while mentees build their skills and confidence. This relationship nurtures growth on both sides, enriching each stylist's personal and professional journey.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion Enhances Creativity:</strong> An inclusive mentorship environment promotes creativity by honoring diversity in talent, background, and perspective. When mentors embrace and celebrate each mentee's individuality, they foster a culture of innovation where diverse ideas and styles flourish. This inclusivity strengthens the industry by attracting and retaining talent from all backgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Reflection Builds Strong Mentorship Foundations:</strong> Developing a clear mentorship philosophy helps mentors provide consistent and meaningful guidance, while introspection allows mentees to understand their own values, goals, and aspirations. Through this self-awareness, both parties establish a strong foundation that guides their mentorship journey.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship Elevates Industry Standards and Drives Innovation:</strong> Mentors set high standards for technical skills, professionalism, and creativity, encouraging mentees to strive for excellence. This elevation of standards helps maintain the profession's reputation while fostering an innovative spirit that drives new trends, techniques, and ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Lifelong Learning Is Essential for Lasting Impact:</strong> Mentorship instills a commitment to continuous growth and improvement, creating a cycle of lifelong learning that enhances individual careers and uplifts the hairstyling profession as a whole. Stylists who value learning and development are more likely to give back, becoming mentors and passing down their knowledge, values, and expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship Strengthens Community Bonds:</strong> Mentorship cultivates a supportive, collaborative community where stylists encourage one another's success. These relationships help prevent burnout, foster camaraderie, and create a nurturing environment that inspires everyone to thrive.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section5-8">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Mentorship in hairstyling is a journey of growth, connection, and shared discovery. Whether seeking to learn or stepping into a mentor role, each stage offers rewards. By building meaningful mentorships, you contribute to a legacy of creativity, inclusivity, and professionalism that enhances the beauty industry and uplifts everyone. As you embark, remember each step, no matter how small, adds to this inspiring profession's richness and resilience.</p>
